  <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>

  <p><strong>Game progress & settings:</strong> are stored locally on the device (SharedPreferences). This includes, for example, level progress, number of hints, task status, and chosen settings.</p>

  <p><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> When the app is launched for the first time, an anonymous account is created via Firebase, which generates a pseudonymous user ID (UID). Optionally, you can log in with Google. In this case, your name, e-mail address, and ID may be transmitted to Firebase. This data is used to restore your game progress or synchronize it across devices.</p>

  <p><strong>Google Play Games Services:</strong> If you sign in with a Google account, information such as user ID, player name, achievements, and cloud game saves can be processed via Google Play Games. These services are provided by Google and are subject to their privacy policy:  
  <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>
  
  <p><strong>Advertising:</strong> The app uses Google AdMob to serve personalized and non-personalized ads. 
  Depending on your consent given in the Privacy Notice (Consent Management Platform, CMP), Google may collect personal data such as device identifiers, approximate location, usage activity, or demographic information 
  to show personalized ads. This may include profiling, measuring ad performance, and selecting and delivering personalized content.</p>
  
  <p>Processing is carried out in accordance with the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a> and is subject to the purposes and partners displayed in the CMP.</p>
  
  <p>Your selection regarding privacy settings is stored locally on your device and automatically applied the next time you start the app. 
  You can change these settings at any time via the privacy settings in the app.</p>

  <p><strong>US States – Privacy Rights:</strong> 
  For users residing in certain US states (e.g., California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut), additional privacy rights apply under applicable law (e.g., CCPA/CPRA). 
  This includes, in particular, the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information (“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”).
  You can change this setting at any time in the <em>Privacy Settings</em> of the app. 
  After opting out, ads will still be displayed, but they will not be personalized.
  For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>3. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to request access, rectification, deletion, restriction of processing, and to object to the processing of your personal data. Please contact us by e-mail.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal data with third parties. The use of Google services (e.g., AdMob, Play Games) is subject to their respective terms and conditions.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy if necessary. The current version is always available here.</p>
